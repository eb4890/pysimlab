Intro
=====

Pysimlab is a laboratory for time based simulations. The ideas is that it can manage the data, models and parameters for different runs of a simulation.

Its speciality is combining different models together, so that many people can work independently on models, that can be later combined into a simulation.

Technology Plans
=====
Pint: to manage the units of the 
Jax & numpy: For speeding up the running of kernels
Ema-workbench: For running multiple simulations under different scenarios
QT5: For the datagrid (using pyspread for inspiration)
matplotlib: visualisation
